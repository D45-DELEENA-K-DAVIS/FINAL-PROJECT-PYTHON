The company requires a comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams. The tasks include preprocessing the dataset, analyzing the data, and presenting your findings graphically. 
Preprocessing: Correct the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180.
Ensure data consistency and integrity before proceeding with analysis.
Analysis Tasks: 
  1. Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
  2. Segregate employees based on their positions within the company.
  3. Identify the predominant age group among employees.
  4. Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
  5. Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually. Graphical Representation: For each of the five analysis tasks, create appropriate visualizations to present your findings effectively.
  6. Data Story: Provide insights gained from the analysis, highlighting key trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset.
